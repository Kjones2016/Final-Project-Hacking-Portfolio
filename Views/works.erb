             <p>I have had experience with sports blogging sites. I did some blogging and articles for thespotonsports.com, which was a start up website by a couple of sports fans.  I also have experience in photography.  I like going to NHRA Drag Races and taking pictures of cars going over 300 m.p.h. in 1000 feet.  It is hard to keep up with the cars and get a good shot, but it is awesome when you can. Below you will find examples of my work.  Enjoy!</p>
